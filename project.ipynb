    "Quantum Computing is a emerging technology which uses quantum mechanics to perform computations, as a conventional computer uses bits which can be 0 or 1, Quantum computing uses qubits which can be in superposition meaning both 0 or 1 at the same time. This creates a new dimension which our classical computers do not have and creates opppurtunity to do much larger scale computations.\n",
