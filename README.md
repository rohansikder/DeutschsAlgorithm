# Exploring Deutsch’s Algorithm

## Executive Summary
This repository provides a comprehensive exploration of Deutsch’s Algorithm within the realm of quantum computing. It includes two notebooks detailing the implementation and understanding of this fundamental quantum algorithm, using Qiskit for practical demonstrations and also tasks given to us.

## Contents
- `project.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook which demonstrates research/learning and representation of Basic Quantum Computing and Deutsch’s Algorithm.
- `tasks.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook encompassing various tasks associated with each topic covered in the module. This includes setup instructions, theoretical explanations.
- `README.md`: Provides an overview of the project and instructions for setup and usage.
