# Exploring Deutsch’s Algorithm

## Executive Summary
This repository provides a comprehensive exploration of Deutsch’s Algorithm within the realm of quantum computing. It includes two notebooks detailing the implementation and understanding of this fundamental quantum algorithm, using Qiskit for practical demonstrations and also tasks given to us.

## Contents
- `project.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook which demonstrates research/learning and representation of Basic Quantum Computing and Deutsch’s Algorithm.
- `tasks.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook encompassing various tasks associated with each topic covered in the module. This includes setup instructions, theoretical explanations.
- `README.md`: Provides an overview of the project and instructions for setup and usage.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Qiskit

### Installing Python 3.x

Python 3.x can be installed from the official Python website. Here's how you can do it:

#### For Windows:

1. Visit the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Download the latest version of Python 3.x for Windows.
3. Run the installer. Ensure that you check the box that says "Add Python 3.x to PATH" before you click "Install Now".

#### For macOS:

1. Visit the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Download the latest version of Python 3.x for macOS.
3. Open the downloaded file and follow the installation instructions.

### Installing Jupyter Notebook

Once Python is installed, you can install Jupyter Notebook using pip, Python's package manager. Here's how to do it:

1. Open your command line or terminal.
2. Install Jupyter Notebook by running:

   ```bash
   pip install notebook
3. Run Notebook
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook

### Installing Qiskit

Qiskit is an open-source quantum computing software development framework. Follow these steps to install Qiskit:

1. Ensure that Python 3.x is already installed on your system.

2. Open your command line or terminal.

3. Install Qiskit by running:

   ```bash
   pip install qiskit
   pip install matplotlib
   pip install qiskit-ibmq-provider

### Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rohansikder/DeutschsAlgorithm.git
